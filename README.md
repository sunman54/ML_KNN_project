# ML_KNN_project
In the first part of this project, the KNN machine learning algorithm was used for the glass dataset. 
The accuracies of the model were calculated on 5-fold cross validation with different k parameters (1,3,5,7,9) 
of the model's different k-NN(with normalization and without normalization) and weighted k-NN (with normalization and without normalization) models.

In the second part of this project, the KNN machine learning algorithm was used for the concrete material strength dataset. 
The accuracies of the model were calculated on 5-fold cross validation with different k parameters (1,3,5,7,9) 
of the model's different k-NN and weighted k-NN  models.
